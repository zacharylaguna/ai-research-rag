# Full Agno Migration - True Agentic RAG

## üéØ What Changed

This is now a **FULL Agno migration** with **true agentic RAG**. The agent autonomously decides when and how to search the knowledge base.

## üîÑ Key Differences from Hybrid Approach

### Before (Hybrid Approach)
```python
# Manual retrieval
retrieved_docs = knowledge_base.search(query, limit=5)

# Manual context preparation
context = prepare_context(retrieved_docs)

# Manual prompt injection
prompt = f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {query}"
response = agent.run(prompt)
```

**Problem**: We were doing the work, not the agent. The agent was just an LLM wrapper.

### After (Full Agno - Agentic RAG)
```python
# Agent autonomously searches knowledge
response = agent.run(query)
```

**Solution**: The agent decides when to search, what to search for, and how to use the results.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### 1. Knowledge Base (`agno_knowledge.py`)

**Now uses Agno's native classes:**
- `TextKnowledgeBase` - Agno's base knowledge class
- `ChromaDb` - Agno's ChromaDB integration
- `FixedSizeChunking` - Agno's chunking strategy
- `Document` - Agno's document class

```python
class AgnoRAGKnowledgeBase(TextKnowledgeBase):
    """Native Agno knowledge base - inherits from Agno's TextKnowledgeBase"""
    
    def __init__(self, ...):
        vector_db = ChromaDb(...)  # Agno's ChromaDB
        super().__init__(
            vector_db=vector_db,
            chunking_strategy=FixedSizeChunking(...)  # Agno's chunking
        )
```

### 2. RAG Service (`rag_service.py`)

**Agent has direct knowledge access:**
```python
self.agent = Agent(
    model=Ollama(id="llama2"),
    knowledge=self.knowledge_base,  # Direct knowledge access!
    search_knowledge=True,  # Enable autonomous search
    show_tool_calls=True,  # See when agent searches
)
```

**Query processing is simple:**
```python
def query(self, query_request):
    # Agent autonomously searches knowledge base
    response = self.agent.run(query_request.query)
    return response
```

## üé® How True Agentic RAG Works

### The Agent's Decision Process

1. **Receives Query**: "What is Agno?"

2. **Agent Thinks**: 
   - "I need information about Agno"
   - "I have access to a knowledge base"
   - "I should search it"

3. **Agent Acts**:
   - Autonomously searches knowledge base
   - Retrieves relevant documents
   - Synthesizes information

4. **Agent Responds**:
   - Provides answer based on retrieved knowledge
   - Cites sources if configured
   - Tracks which documents were used

### What You'll See

With `show_tool_calls=True`, you'll see:
```
[Agent] Searching knowledge base for: "Agno framework"
[Agent] Found 3 relevant documents
[Agent] Generating response...
```

## üìä Comparison

| Feature | Hybrid Approach | Full Agno (Current) |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Knowledge Search | Manual (we do it) | Autonomous (agent does it) |
| Context Preparation | Manual | Automatic |
| Prompt Engineering | Required | Minimal |
| Agent Autonomy | Low | High |
| Code Complexity | Higher | Lower |
| True Agentic Behavior | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

## üîß Configuration

### Agent Configuration

```python
Agent(
    name="RAG Assistant",
    model=Ollama(id="llama2"),
    knowledge=knowledge_base,  # ‚Üê Key: Direct knowledge access
    
    # Enable autonomous knowledge search
    search_knowledge=True,
    
    # Show when agent searches (useful for debugging)
    show_tool_calls=True,
    
    # Instructions guide the agent's behavior
    instructions=[
        "Search your knowledge base to find relevant information",
        "Base answers on knowledge base content",
        "Cite sources when possible"
    ]
)
```

### Knowledge Base Configuration

```python
AgnoRAGKnowledgeBase(
    path="./chroma_db",
    collection_name="documents",
    chunk_size=1000,  # Agno handles chunking
    chunk_overlap=200
)
```

## üöÄ Benefits of Full Agno

### 1. True Agent Autonomy
- Agent decides when to search
- Agent determines what to search for
- Agent synthesizes information intelligently

### 2. Simpler Code
- No manual retrieval logic
- No context preparation
- No prompt engineering for RAG

### 3. Better Performance
- Agent optimizes its own searches
- Can perform multiple searches if needed
- Learns from context

### 4. Scalability
- Easy to add more knowledge sources
- Agent handles complexity
- Can add tools alongside knowledge

## üìù API Compatibility

**Good news**: API endpoints remain 100% compatible!

```bash
# Same endpoints work exactly the same
POST /documents
POST /documents/batch
POST /documents/upload
POST /query  # ‚Üê Now uses true agentic RAG!
GET /health
GET /stats
DELETE /documents
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Adding Documents
```python
# Documents are added to Agno's knowledge base
# Agno handles chunking automatically
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/documents",
    json={
        "content": "Agno is a high-performance agentic framework...",
        "metadata": {"source": "docs"}
    }
)
```

### Querying (Agentic RAG)
```python
# Agent autonomously searches knowledge base
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/query",
    json={
        "query": "What is Agno?",
        "top_k": 5
    }
)

# Agent found relevant info and synthesized an answer
print(response.json()["answer"])
```

## üîç How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Logs
```bash
python main.py
```

Look for:
```
INFO: RAG service initialized with Agno agentic RAG (autonomous knowledge search)
INFO: Processing query with agentic RAG: What is Agno?
INFO: Agent responded with X source references
```

### 2. Watch Agent Behavior
With `show_tool_calls=True`, you'll see the agent's actions:
- When it searches the knowledge base
- What it searches for
- How many results it found

### 3. Test Queries
```bash
# Add a document
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/documents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Agno is 10,000x faster than LangGraph", "metadata": {}}'

# Query it - agent will autonomously search
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How fast is Agno?", "top_k": 3}'
```

## üé® Advanced: Multi-Agent Teams

With full Agno, you can now easily add agent teams:

```python
# Web search agent
web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]
)

# Knowledge base agent
kb_agent = Agent(
    name="KB Agent",
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True
)

# Team coordinator
team = Agent(
    name="Coordinator",
    team=[web_agent, kb_agent],
    instructions=[
        "First check the knowledge base",
        "If needed, search the web for recent info"
    ]
)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Agent not searching knowledge

**Check:**
1. `search_knowledge=True` in Agent config
2. Knowledge base has documents
3. Ollama is running

### Issue: No sources in response

**Note**: Agno agents may not always expose source references in the response object. This is normal - the agent used the knowledge internally.

**Workaround**: Enable `show_tool_calls=True` to see searches in logs.

### Issue: Agent gives generic answers

**Solution**: Improve instructions:
```python
instructions=[
    "ALWAYS search your knowledge base before answering",
    "Base ALL answers on knowledge base content",
    "If knowledge base has no info, say so explicitly"
]
```
